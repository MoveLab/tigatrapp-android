<h2><b>Learn about the tiger mosquito</b></h2>
Learn to recognize the tiger mosquito and make sure not to confuse it with other mosquitoes. Learn about the mosquito\'s life cycle and breeding places. The app and the project website AtrapaelTigre.com contain all the information necessary for gathering quality data.

<h2>Begin sharing data </h2>
Use the "PARTICIPATE" buttons on the main screen to send reports on breeding sites in public spaces and sightings of adult tiger mosquitoes. You\'ll find detailed information by clicking the information (i) icons.

<h2>Keep your information updated </h2>
Use the "MY MAP" button to view your reports and edit them if necessary to update or correct information.

<h2>Volunteer for missions</h2>
If you are using the Android version of Tigatrapp, you will be notified of special missions by an icon appearing on your device\'s status bar. You can volunteer for mission at any time, postpone it for later, or delete it from your device. Check pending missions from the menu options on the main screen.

<h1>YOUR DATA</h1>
The information you submit is sent to the Centre for Advanced Studies of Blanes (CEAB-CSIC), which is coordinating the AtrapaelTigre.com project. The data will be used to learn more about the spread of tiger mosquitoes in Spain and may be shared with third parties or the public.
 
Tigatrapp also collects coarse information on your location at random times throughout the day in order to generate a map of the areas being monitored by Tigatrapp users, and to learn about the routes along which tiger mosquitoes may be spreading. These locations are masked by placing rounding your actual location to the nearest 0.5 degrees latitude and longitude, making it possible  to know that you were in an area roughly the size of XXX, but impossible to know where you were in that area. The locations are linked only to your randomly-generated user ID, and no personally-itentifying information is collected.

Parts of the data you share will be automatically published on the web map at AtrapaelTigre.com. At any time you can delete, edit and update the data on this map from your phone by clicking the "MY MAP" button on the main screen and selecting a report.
