        <item>Female tiger mosquito. Tiger mosquitoes (1) are small and black with white stripes, 
        (2) they have a white stripe on the head and thorax, and (3) they have white stripes on the abdomen 
        and legs. There are other similar insects, so it is important to avoid confusing them!</item>
        <item>Female tiger mosquito. Note the stripes on the abdomen. 
        Remember that the tiger mosquito is very small, 
        not more than 5 mm (including legs, about half the size of a 1 cent coin).</item>
        <item>Female tiger mosquito ready to bite. 
        Note the white stripe on the head and thorax, and the stripes on the legs .</item>

        <item>Female tiger mosquito biting. 
        Note the characteristic white stripe on the head and thorax. </item>
        <item>Two female tiger mosquitoes biting. Remember that only the females bite. 
        Tiger mosquitoes usually bite during the day (not when it\'s dark)
         and they usually bite legs.</item>
        <item>Female tiger mosquito biting. 
        The blood that accumulates in the abdomen will trigger the laying of eggs.</item>
        <item>Tiger mosquito laying eggs. Note the eggs\' dark color and elongated shape. 
        The eggs are so small that they are almost invisible to the naked eye. 
        Remember that the tiger mosquito lays eggs in small containers, 
        on dry walls by stagnant and dirty water.</item>
        <item>Tiger mosquito larvae (more elongated) and pupae (more rounded).
        Note that they are aquatic. 
        The larvae emerge from the eggs when they are covered with water and eventually make 
        the transition to pupae.</item>
        <item>Tiger mosquito larvae (more elongated) and pupae (more rounded). 
        Remember that to keep tiger mosquitos out of your home you need to avoid having standing 
        water in which the larvae can develop!</item>
        <item>Two tiger mosquito pupae. 
        This is the phase in which metamorphosis occurs, and the adult
         mosquito emerges from the pupa and enters the aerial environment.</item>

<b>Want to help study and monitor tiger mosquitoes in Spain? Tigatrapp lets you  
share information about mosquito breeding sites and adult mosquito sightings with researchers and the public. It also brings you the latest tiger mosquito news and helps you learn how to keep this insect out of your home.</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn about the tiger mosquito and its breeding sites. You\'ll find everything you need in the app and on the project website.</li>

<li>Share data. Send reports when you spot adult tiger mosquitoes or breeding sites in public spaces. You will be helping to build the first-ever crowdsourced map of tiger mosquitoes in Spain.</li> 

<li>Store and edit your own data in your phone or tablet from the app\'s mapping screen.</li>

<li>Much more -- from volunteering for special tiger mosquito missions to keeping up with the latest news about tiger mosquitoes and the AtrapaelTigre.com project.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>All of the reports I submit on breeding sites, adult mosquito sightings, and tiger mosquito missions. This includes my precise location when submitting each report, and any photographs, notes or other information or media that I attach. </li>

<li>Coarse information about my locations at other times, sampled at random time intervals. This information is collected in order to build a map of the geographic areas that you are monitoring for tiger mosquitoes, and to learn more about the routes along which tiger mosquitoes may be spreading.</li>

<li>Information about my phone model, battery power, language settings, and Tigatrapp installation. This information is used to help the research team improve the app.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>I understand that Tigatrapp does not collect information about identified or identifiable individuals, according to the Organic Law 15/1999.

<p>Tigatrapp, versió 1.0</p>

<p>Tigatrapp is an application that harnesses the power of citizen scientists and new technologies to  
investigate the spread of Tiger Mosquitoes in Spain. 
The application was developed by the 
 Movement Ecology Laboratory of the Center for Advanced Studies of Blanes (CEAB-CSIC).
  The code is drawn in part from Space Mapper (John R.B. Palmer), and the Human Mobility Project 
 (Chang Y. Chung, Kathleen Li and Necati E. Ozgencil). 
 The Tigatrapp code is freely available from the Movement Ecology Lab.</p>

<h1><b>PARTICIPATE</b></h1>
<p>Participate in the study and monitoring of tiger mosquitoes in Spain by sending repors on breeding sites and adult tiger mosquito sightings. Get the latest news and learn to combat tiger mosquitoes in your home.</p>

<h2><b>Learn about the tiger mosquito</b></h2>
Learn to recognize the tiger mosquito and make sure not to confuse it with other mosquitoes. Learn about the mosquito\'s life cycle and breeding places. The app and the project website AtrapaelTigre.com contain all the information necessary for gathering quality data.

<h2>Begin sharing data </h2>
Use the "PARTICIPATE" buttons on the main screen to send reports on breeding sites in public spaces and sightings of adult tiger mosquitoes. You\'ll find detailed information by clicking the information (i) icons.

<h2>Keep your information updated </h2>
Use the "MY MAP" button to view your reports and edit them if necessary to update or correct information.

<h2>Volunteer for missions</h2>
If you are using the Android version of Tigatrapp, you will be notified of special missions by an icon appearing on your device\'s status bar. You can volunteer for mission at any time, postpone it for later, or delete it from your device. Check pending missions from the menu options on the main screen.

<h2>Explore other options</h2>
Explore the options menus on each screen to access features. Change the base map style, share the app with friends, or check the latest news from AtrapaelTigre.com.
 

<h1>YOUR DATA</h1>
The information you submit is sent to the Centre for Advanced Studies of Blanes (CEAB-CSIC), which is coordinating the AtrapaelTigre.com project. The data will be used to learn more about the spread of tiger mosquitoes in Spain and may be shared with third parties or the public.
 
Tigatrapp also collects coarse information on your location at random times throughout the day in order to generate a map of the areas being monitored by Tigatrapp users, and to learn about the routes along which tiger mosquitoes may be spreading. These locations are masked by placing rounding your actual location to the nearest 0.5 degrees latitude and longitude, making it possible  to know that you were in an area roughly the size of XXX, but impossible to know where you were in that area. The locations are linked only to your randomly-generated user ID, and no personally-itentifying information is collected.

Parts of the data you share will be automatically published on the web map at AtrapaelTigre.com. At any time you can delete, edit and update the data on this map from your phone by clicking the "MY MAP" button on the main screen and selecting a report.
