<b>Want to help study and monitor tiger mosquitoes in Spain? Tigatrapp lets you  
share information about mosquito breeding sites and adult mosquito sightings with researchers and the public. It also brings you the latest tiger mosquito news and helps you learn how to keep this insect out of your home.</b>

<ol>
<li>Learn about the tiger mosquito and its breeding sites. You'll find everything you need in the app and on the project website.</li>

<li>Share data. Send reports when you spot adult tiger mosquitoes or breeding sites in public spaces. You will be helping to build the first-ever crowdsourced map of tiger mosquitoes in Spain.</li> 

<li>Store and edit your own data in your phone or tablet from the app's mapping screen.</li>

<li>Much more -- from volunteering for special tiger mosquito missions to keeping up with the latest news about tiger mosquitoes and the AtrapaelTigre.com project.</li>
